            "explanation": "I have been studying Japanese for years but I always struggled with verb conjugation. I was never satisfied with any of the tools available for studying because they didn't adequately drill conjugation. I wanted a tool for studying verbs and conjugation that used a 'spaced repetition' approach because I enjoyed using other tools like wanikani.com.  Being a software developer I decided it was time to write one. ",

            "limitation3": "You should know Hiragana and Katakana and basic kanji (or be willing to learn quickly).  This app is about learning conjugation.  There are plenty of other better places to start to learn Japanese in general.  But this tool can help a beginner or intermediate student master a skill that can be surprisingly frustrating.",
            "limitation4": "There are many useful する verbs that you should know, but since this app is about learning how to conjugate the various verb types and all suru verbs conjugate the same way they have not been included. ",
