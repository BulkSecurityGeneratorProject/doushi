            "explanation": "I have been studying Japanese for years but I always struggled with verb conjugation. I was never satisfied with any of the tools available for studying because they didn't adequately drill conjugation. I wanted a tool for studying verbs and conjugation that used a 'spaced repetition' approach because I enjoyed using other tools like wanikani.com.  Being a software developer I decided it was time to write one. ",

There are plenty of other better places to start to Japanese in general.  But this tool can help beginner and intermediate students master a skill that can be surprisingly frustrating.",
